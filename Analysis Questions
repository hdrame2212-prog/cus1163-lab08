1. In the example you gave us, the percentage is 8.71. The memory becomes fragmented because P1 left a hole 0-99 and P4 fits part of the hole
but not all of it, which then leaves a gap in memory. The rest of the memory is one big chunk in comparison.

2. P4 uses the block left by P1 because the FIFO method always takes the first big enough hole, even if the hole is too big. The extra space that 
isn't used by P4 becomes a separate free memory. 

3.Workload1.txt creates more fragmentation because there are more smaller processes, which create more smaller holes compared to
creating fewer, bigger holes, which results in less fragmentation

4. Allocation can fail even though total free memory is larger than the request because the free space is split into many smaller separate holes, and 
you would need large chunks or one continuous block of memory. So let's say the total free memory is 600, but the largest hole is only 200. There is 
enough memory altogether, but there needs to be enough memory in at least one chunk .

5. Best fit would choose the smallest hole that is big enough for the request. Best fit would still put 50KB in the 0-99 hole because 
that is the smallest hole so it would behave the same as FIFO. However, in other cases, like if 0-99 wasn't the smallest, Best Fit can reduce 
fragmentation because it can leave larger spaces untouched. In this case, fragmentation is not reduced
